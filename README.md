This repository contains example IAM policies for AWS, designed following the principle of least privilege. The policies demonstrate how to grant only the minimum permissions necessary for specific AWS services, helping improve security and compliance.

Key Features
- KMS Policies – decrypt-only or encrypt/decrypt access scoped to specific keys.
- S3 Policies – read-only or write access limited to individual buckets.
- IAM Role Examples – JSON files ready to attach to EC2, Lambda, or other services.
- Safe and GitHub-friendly – contains no access keys or secrets, making it safe to share.

Purpose
- Learn and practice AWS IAM role creation with least-privilege principles.
- Provide a reference for building secure IAM policies in real projects.
- Organize policies in a reusable, structured format.
